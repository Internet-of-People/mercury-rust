 The application has two modus operandi (selected via command line args) 

 Client - Connects to the server via the dApp SDK. 
    If connection failed, exits with an error code 
    or retries with exponential timeout or exits immediately 
    (controlled by a command line switch). 
 
 Server - Able to provide notifications to connected clients in case of events. 
    Events can be raised via a timer, 
    on a specific byte arriving on a uds, 
    or via signal (SIGUSR2).
