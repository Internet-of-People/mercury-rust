# 0002. Choosing Cap'n'Proto

Date: 2018-03-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need something better than ProtoBuf

## Decision

We checked the Cap'n'Proto documentation and examples on RPC.
Seems to be a perfect match for our needs, so we started integrating it to our SDK for communication between client/server, replacing the previous ProtoBuf.

## Consequences

-
